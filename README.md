## Description

This is my second project created in the process of becoming the Frontend Developer. I have created a simple currency conventer that allows you to exchange Polish currency PLN into some other currencies.

## How it works

1. Enter the amount of PLN in the *Polski złoty* section.
2. Choose currency in the *Waluty* section.
3. Click the *POLICZ* button.
4. Your calculation will be shown below *POLICZ* button.
